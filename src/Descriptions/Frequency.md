## Frequency

Frequency refers to the number of buses that pass through a given segment in a set time frame. For this analysis, the frequency includes all buses travelling on any route in any direction on the segment. We use two measures of frequency to represent both peak and general all-day frequency.

- **All-Day Volume:** Total number of buses traveling both directions on this segment, on any route, throughout the day
- **Max Hourly Frequency:** Number of buses observed in the single busiest hour of the day

We use the following table to determine scores based on the two frequency metrics defined above.
